### Hello, Iâ€™m **Rob**

I'm a software developer based in Antwerp, Belgium. Over the years, I've written things in Java, Python,
NodeJs and more. Aside from writing code, I use AWS and Kubernetes to make any solution as solid as the
2010-2011 FC Barcelona lineup.

Apart from developing applications, I'm passionate about triathlon and basketball.

I'll write more in the future. In the meantime, feel free to reach out on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/robkenis) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/robkenis).
